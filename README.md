# Webpacker now supports react.js ðŸŽ‰ 

</div>

This unfortunately piqued my interest and I wanted to create an "all in one" app using it.  
Created using:  

```
rails new todoList-RubyAPI -d=postgresql --webpacker=react
```

### Technical Requirements

---

:heavy_check_mark: Have at least one database model <br>
:heavy_check_mark: Include wireframes <br>
:heavy_check_mark: Have semantically clean HTML and CSS <br>
:heavy_check_mark: Be deployed online
:heavy_check_mark: A working full-stack or expanded API application, built by you, that has full CRUD functionality

### The Stack

---

- [`Ruby on Rails`] - backend API
- [`React`]
- [`Postgres`]


### Usage

---

Running the server side - Ruby on Rails:

```sh
rails install
rails server
```

Running the client - React:

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```
Wireframes go here. 

User stories go here.
